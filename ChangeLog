Antidote 2.1
------------

* Health Manager (healthd) source broken in modules:
  healthd_common, healthd_ipc_*. Common code among
  healthd_service and healthd_android is at healthd_common,
  removing code redundancy

* Removed code redundancy among sample agents

* Applications moved from src/ to apps/; src/ only contains
  the Antidote library and plug-ins now

* BlueZ HDP plug-in improvements: delay disconnection event
  until channel is effectively destroyed, not merely closed.

* Added RORJ and ROER APDU handling

* Multithreading improvements, API changes

* Moved connection and disconnection events to core,
  API changes

* Refactoring of writer streams (for e.g. encoding APDUs)

* APDU encoder refactoring

* Set-Time transcoding support

* PM-Store fixes (mostly API-level)

* strbuff optimization (benefits e.g. XML and JSON encoders)

* JSON encoder fix

* Removed FIFO communication plug-in


Antidote 2.0.5
--------------

* Added Set-Time support to top-level APIs

* Removed FIFO support

* Added sdk/ folder with tools

* HANDLE typedef renamed to ASN1_HANDLE to facilitate,
  and other changes to facilitate porting to Windows

* Many Doxygen documentation fixes

* Improved TCP/IP communication plug-ins

* Fixed compilation of sample_bt_agent (added @GIO_LIBS@)
  that seems to break compilation in Ubuntu 12.04

* Added Java example of healthd client (doc/examples/java).

* Many small bugfixes


Antidote 2.0
------------

* Added multiple communication plugins support

* Added transcoding support
  There is a separate transcoding plugin system
  Example oximeter transcoder in src/trans/plugin

* PM-Store full support
  Added/improved healthd API methods regarding PM-Store

* Added GetConfiguration method to healthd API
  Needed by PM-Store operations and for proper event
  report structure introspection

* Many bugfixes

* Port to Android ICS

* USB PHDC device class plug-in (linux/libusb)

* Improved test_healthd.py, many optional parameters

* Improved healthd, USB and transcoding support
  --auto for auto-testing and consumption of events
  --usb for USB plugin activation
  --tcp for TCP-based serving, in place of D-Bus
  --trans for transcoding support

* Improved error handling in APDU decoding

* Added warning messages to APDU encoding procedures

* Encoding and decoding routines refactored

Antidote 1.1
------------

* IEEE 11073 Agent capability has been implemented.

* Several architectural changes to support Agent role.
  In particular, plugin interface has been extended.

* FIFO, TCP/IP and Bluetooth/BlueZ plug-ins were extended
  to support both Agent and Manager roles.

* Oximeter specialization extended for Agent capability
  (generation of event reports with oximeter data).

* Added agent sample application: ieee_agent. This is mostly
  for local testing with ieee_manager, and communicates over
  TCP/IP and FIFO channels.

* Added agent sample application: sample_bt_agent. This uses
  the Bluetooth / BlueZ communication plug-in, and can connect
  to any Bluetooth-based Manager (note that HDP profile is
  encrypted so devices must be paired).

* Some src/*.c files have been renamed to more sensible names
  (some "historical" names did not reflect their present
  usage).

* Old Bluetooth plug-in based on bare MCAP has been removed.

* ieee_agent and ieee_manager no longer have the D-Bus option
  (which was linked to obsolete MCAP plug-in). They only
  have FIFO and TCP/IP. Refer to sample_bt_agent and healthd
  if you want Bluetooth-based examples for Agent and Manager,
  respectively.

* A number of random fixes, including Doxygen documentation
  fixes.

* Added a TODO to source tree with technical backlog.
